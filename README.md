# Hello, I'm Bruna Melo! :wave::smiley: 

## UX/UI Designer | Front-End Developer

### Let me introduce a little bit about my journey

My aptitude for exacts since high school led me to the engineering college, where I got a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering :woman_student: :test_tube:. As an engineer, I had the pleasure of being part of the process engineering team of a german chemical company for three years :woman_scientist:.

During this time, through intense process data analysis and dashboards creations :bar_chart:, I was not only allowed to perfect my engineering skills in the chemical area. 

I also discovered high abilities in data management, logical flow creation, and aesthetically pleasing reports interface development that connected to the end consumer of the information :woman_technologist:. 

As a daughter of two generations of local market owners :convenience_store:, I have always learned about serving people by meeting their needs with my work. 

The combination of these two massive experiences guided me to the <strong>UX/UI Design</strong> and <strong>Front-End Development</strong> fields. 

I'm currently in a career transition to this tech area in which I have been finding my thing :blush:. My goal is to act with a human-centered approach, helping create features that will meet this generation's challenges and bring their dreams to life with my skills. 

<strong>I am looking forward to the opportunities! :star2:</strong>
